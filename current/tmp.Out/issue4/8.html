                         .o ELF loader in a CTF task

"Bookmark" or "ELF .o loader" in the text below.

A few years back I was thinking a bit about ways to improve Address Space
Layout Randomization (ASLR) mechanism. I played around with the idea to
increase the number of elements that are actually randomized. For libraries
and executable images, just their base address is randomized – but everything
within said image stays at the same position relative to other elements of
this image. What if we could shuffle the order of things inside the image as
well? Maybe shuffle the function order? Or at least shuffle the compilation
units around?

┄─━┫Glossary
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) – A mechanism to allocate typical
memory regions at unguessable addresses to make exploitation harder. After
all, if the attacker doesn't know where something is, it's hard for them to
use it in an exploit. Each operating system has this implemented in a bit of a
different fashion, though typically it results in the addresses of memory
allocations for executables, dynamic libraries, stacks, heaps, or individual
memory allocations being somewhat random. In practice, while ASLR is useful,
leaking a couple of pointers is usually enough to defeat it.
┄

At the time, I was still on Google's security team. One thing I was working on
was Google CTF 2022 qualification round – a security Capture The Flag hacking
competition, known for its insane level of difficulty. During a CTF tournament
teams solve challenges (tasks) from various categories, including e.g.
low-level exploitation, colloquially known as pwn. As such, I decided it would
be a fun idea to create a CTF task with a custom loader that worked with
individual compilation units (i.e. .o object files) and shuffled them around
in memory.

As a CTF task can be enjoyed from both the Player's and the Creator's
perspectives, the remainder of this article will alternate between these two
viewpoints. The Player will walk through the solution process, while the
Creator will comment on key decisions made during the design and
implementation of the challenge. I hope you'll forgive this little exercise in
multiple personalities, but I believe it will make this rather lengthy article
more enjoyable.

The challenge, including its source code, is available under the Apache 2.0
license here:

│ Currently, a consensus seems to be emerging that players should be  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│

│ (e.g. how would a user's terminal send the SIGWINCH aka "terminal   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│

│ The choice of LFSR algorithm to generate numbers was a pretty       ⠀⣿⣿⣿⡷⠀⠀│
│ simple one – it allows to easily and precisely control how much     ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ state is leaked, in bits. This said, it also required a conscious   ⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀│
│ act of balancing – leaking too many bits would make the task too    ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ easy; leaking too few would render the task unsolvable (or, in a    ⠀⢀⣿⣿⣿⡀⠀│
│ best case scenario, require brute forcing some bits, likely in an   ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ online brute forcing at that, i.e. hammering the server).           ⠀⣿⡷⠶⢾⣿⠀│

│ One more potential problem is that LFSR's output is periodic, i.e.  ⠀⡿⠀⠀⠀⢿⠀│
│ after some outputs the pattern starts repeating itself. The length  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ of this cycle depends on which bits are "tapped", i.e. which bits   ⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀│
│ are used when calculating the new bit. So, what I needed to avoid,  ⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀│
│ is having a super short cycle, since that would require just a few  ⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀│
│ bits leaked to uncover the whole pseudo-random bit stream.          ⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀│

│ The rule for the maximal cycle length is an even number of taps     ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ (the complement, i.e. XOR with 1, doesn't count) and the indexes of ⠀⢀⣿⣿⣿⡀⠀│
│ bits (counting from 1) being set-wise coprime (i.e. there must be   ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ no number apart from 1 that is a factor of ALL the numbers in the   ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│

│ Let's start by recognizing the fact that .o files used by the GNU   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ GCC and compatible toolchains are just ELF files. There are however ⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀│
│ a few minor differences between a typical executable ELFs and the   ⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀│
│ half-built object ELF files. The differences however are NOT in the ⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀│
│ file format itself – that part is identical – but rather in the     ⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀│
│ actual content serialized within these ELFs.                        ⠀⠀⠀⡿⠀⠀⠀│
│                                                                     ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ The are two major differences:                                      ⠀⢀⣿⣿⣿⡀⠀│
│                                                                     ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ 1. Executable ELFs contain a Program Header, which tells the loader ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ how and where to load the content into memory. Object ELFs don't    ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ have the Program Header – there are no segments, only sections.     ⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⠁⠀│
│ 2. Executable ELFs sections have Virtual Memory Addresses           ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ calculated and set – i.e. the linker has already written in stone   ⠀⣾⣿⣿⣿⡀⠀│
│ relative offsets of cross-section references. Sections in object    ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ ELFs don't have VMAs set (they are all zeroes), and therefore they  ⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⡁⠀│
│ contain additional relocation information for cross-section         ⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ references.                                                         ⠀⡿⠀⠀⠀⢿⠀│

│ There are also some smaller differences, like the fact that a set   ⠀⠀⠀⠠⡀⠀⠀│
│ of .o files won't have an entry point (start address) set, so for   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢣⠀⠀│
│ this use-case a chosen exported symbol has to be used instead.      ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣶⠀│
│                                                                     ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ So, how to load a bunch of object ELFs into memory and execute them ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⡀│
│ as an application? Actually the process is pretty similar to doing  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣿⠇│
│ the same with a normal executable ELF and its set of dynamic        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⣸⡿⠀│
│ libraries. On the high level that's loading the sections (not       ⠀⠀⠀⢰⣿⠁⠀│
│ segments!) into memory, applying relocations, and cross-linking     ⠀⠀⢠⣿⠃⠀⠀│
│ dependencies.                                                       ⠀⠀⣾⡏⠀⠀⠀│

│ In practice this loader does this in 3 steps, or rather 3 "phases"  ⠀⢸⡏⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ as I've called it in the source code. The phases are run one after  ⠀⢸⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ the other on whole sets of object ELFs, i.e. at the start the first ⠀⠸⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ phase is run for all .o files, then the second phase is run for all ⠀⠀⢣⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ the .o files, and then the final phase is run for all the .o files. ⠀⠀⠈⢆⠀⠀⠀│
│ This order makes it easy to deal with cross-dependencies (imports   ⠀⠀⠀⠘⡄⠀⠀│
│ and exports).                                                       ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢱⠀⠀│

│ What also has to be noted, is that no .o file actually lists other  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│

│ for the sake of a CTF challenge the list of .o files was just       ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⣿⠃│

│ The first allocation is a bit out of order – 4KB of readable and    ⠀⠀⣸⡿⠀⠀⠀│

│ What's worth noting, is that an object ELF does not have a PLT      ⠀⢸⡟⠀⠀⠀⠀│

│ during the compilation process (alongside the .got and .got.plt     ⠀⢸⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀│

│ If you look again at the major differences between executable and   ⠀⠘⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ object ELFs, and pair them up with ASLR, you will notice an         ⠀⠀⢱⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ interesting possibility – there is no reason to keep the sections   ⠀⠀⠀⢇⠀⠀⠀│
│ next to each other. I.e. rather than keeping the sections together  ⠀⠀⠀⠈⡆⠀⠀│

│ basically split into different spots in memory. The only            ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ restriction there is to keep them within a reach of 32-bit relative ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ addressing (signed), as such is commonly used in relocations. All   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⡆│
│ of this is thanks to the fact that at the object file stage we      ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⣿⠃│
│ still have more relocation entries than "survive" the linking       ⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⡏⠀│
│ process.                                                            ⠀⠀⠀⣼⡟⠀⠀│

│ So, the decision that had to be made was whether to make this       ⠀⢀⣿⠇⠀⠀⠀│
│ challenge even harder by ASLRing the sections all across a 2GB      ⠀⢸⡿⠀⠀⠀⠀│
│ block (to conform with the signed 32-bit requirement), or whether   ⠀⢸⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀│

│ I eventually decided to keep it simple and have the sections        ⠀⠀⠸⡀⠀⠀⠀│
│ bunched up as usual – the main reason was that ASLRing the sections ⠀⠀⠀⢱⠀⠀⠀│
│ would also leak additional bits of entropy, and that would make the ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢇⠀⠀│

│ As such, the sections are instead aligned to 0x1000 boundaries, but ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀│
│ otherwise kept one after the other in memory. An interesting        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⡇│
│ side-effect of this alignment is that whatever section addresses    ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⠀│
│ IDA or Ghidra will show the Player, it will likely be different     ⠀⠀⠀⢠⣿⠃⠀│

Eventually the task was solved by quite a lot of teams, as expected on a top
level CTF. A few write-ups also were published. If you'd like to read them,
you can find them at:

https://kileak.github.io/ctf/2022/googlectf22-fixedaslr/
https://chovid99.github.io/posts/google-ctf-2022/#fixed-aslr
https://ctftime.org/writeup/34483

It was pretty fun to make and it received pretty positive feedback – at least
from players that managed to solve it ;)

And that's it! ELFs are fun, aren't they?
