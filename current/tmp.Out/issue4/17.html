─── BGGP5 Wrapped ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\\──

Wow! Another year, another BGGP. The theme this year was "Download". The goal
was to download a file from the Binary Golf website (https://binary.golf/5/5)
and display it in some way.

We got over 120 entries and 50 file formats! We had a number of new file
formats, including Adobe ExtendScript, Erlang BEAM Bytecode, LaTeX, and
LLVM-IR.

Let's get into what happened!

::: Approaches To The Challenge ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This was our example entry:

    #!/bin/sh
    wget https://binary.golf/5/5
    cat 5

And expected output:

    $ ./bggp5.sh
    Another #BGGP5 download!! @binarygolf https://binary.golf

Downloading a file seems simple enough right? You do this every day, and it Just
Works. When you think about it, there is actually a lot more work going on.

A classic interview question is "What happens when you type google.com into your
browser and press enter?". You can go infinitely into the weeds on this, from
the prefrontal and parietal cortex planning the movement of your fingers, to
the premotor and motor cortex sequencing and sending commands to move your
fingers, to even more low level biological and atomic actions involved in your
brain and the CPU you are interfacing with. For our purposes, we want to know
what you need from a computer's perspective to download a file.

The basic steps are:

- Resolve the domain with a DNS query
- Create a TCP Socket using the system's socket APIs.
- Perform a TLS Handshake with the host
- Send an HTTP GET Request
- Read the response
- Display the contents

Depending on your target system and file format, some of these steps many be
handled for you.

The file to download in this challenge was hosted on the Binary Golf website,
which uses TLS and is served via Github. This was one of the more significant
hurdles for BGGP5, as code that can negotiate TLS or other cryptographic APIs
can add a non-trivial amount of bytes and complexity to a given entry.

Let's take a look at how golfers approached this and other aspects of the
challenge!

::: Living Off The Land ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

While many programming languages and libraries offer APIs to download content
from the internet, many golfers opted to use binaries or features that are
usually already on a given target system.

Curl seemed to be the most popular choice for this, as it is common on Linux,
MacOS, and even Windows, and has been compiled for 101 operating systems and
28 CPU architectures and counting. Since it can handle all the TLS negotiation
for you, and the default behavior is to display the content from the host, it
was an obvious choice for many.

Others went with OpenSSL, which can be used to establish TLS connections and
allow users to send/receive HTTP requests and responses. An impressive example
was neuschaefer's ELF written in ARM Jazelle DBX, using OpenSSL to get the file.

bah's entry implemented a wild dynamic linking idea that patched /bin/bash in
memory and overwrote main() with code to dlopen() libssl, then call it to
download the file.

retr0id used KTLS and Linux Kernel Crypto APIs to make a static aarch64
userland curl implementation that calls these APIs. While the file itself was
3043 bytes, it demonstrated interesting use of cryptography in the kernel.

::: To Arg Or Not To Arg? ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

One of the key distinctions for this and other BGGP challenges was whether or
not an entry uses command line arguments. Environment variables can also be used
to hold data and code. For each file format, entries that used arguments or
environment variables were scored separately from entries that were a standalone
file. The URL for file to download was 23 bytes, so using arguments or env vars
made sense to make an entry even smaller.

::: URL Shorteners :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We didn't explicitly ban URL shorteners or small domain names because we didn't
want to limit how small people could go, or limit people targeting systems and
formats that predate SSL/TLS and required a proxy. Many people flexed their 5 or
6 byte domain names.

::: File Name Hax ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Another approach that helped people save space this year was to use the filename
as code.

continue won python without args (and pyc), by executing the entire filename as
a script.

mebeim and Digoguenes used the filesystem itself to store the URL with their PHP
entries, by creating directories that pointed to binary.golf/5/5

gremlinbeet's 3 byte batch file entry ran a powershell script from the filename,
which caused the system to reboot and display the contents from a text file on
next boot.

Luna Hart's 2 byte shell script stored the entire command in the filename, and
executed with a simple $0.

jbo also did a 2 byte shell script with arguments that executed $1.

::: 0 Bytes ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In previous years, we have explicitly states that 0 byte files weren't allowed.
This year, we forgot to put that in the challenge, and as a result, got some
cool "0 byte" files that achieved the goal. In future BGGP challenges, we can
make a one liner category to collect some of these cool tricks!

─── AWARDS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\\──

::: Most Popular File Format :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

ELF had 12 entries across all the subdivisions.

::: Smallest Entry :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Tie between Luna Hart (2 byte shell script no args) and JBO (2 byte shell script
with args).

::: Most Entries :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The top 3 golfers with the most entries were:
- mattpass - 9
- jbo - 8
- tied for third: caioluders, mebeim, and vvx7 with 6 each

4 golfers had wins in 4 categories.

::: Wildest Entry ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

qkumba wins the award for "Wildest Entry" with his absolutely mad COM file
written in 16 bit x86 assembly. The submission itself is a base64 string,
with a base64 decoder in the code, that you can paste into notepad and
execute. Golf claps for qkumba all around.

─── Looking Forward ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\\──

We made a few changes this year to our process to try to make things easier for
both golfers and verifiers. This year we started using git issues on the BGGP
repo to track entries, verification, and discussion around them. It also makes
it easier for verifiers to track the status of an entry or any changes/updates
to it.

Verifying the entries this year took a bit longer than expected for a variety of
reasons. There will be a follow up blog to this about ways we plan to improve,
and ways you can get involved and tell us what you would like to see in the
future. Follow the Binary Golf Association on socials for more info!

We also have a new experimental tool to process BGGPx entry files. Feel free to
play with it and help us improve! https://github.com/binarygolf/bggp-tools

BGGP is becoming a lot more well known, with entries being cited in papers, used
for testing by organizations and companies, and increasing coverage in media
outlets. The more accessible we can make our data set, the better.
