sl^tmachine is a metamorphic AARCH64 ELF virus that implements a PT_NOTE to
PT_LOAD infection method and a few obfuscation techniques. This txt acts as
a supplement to the virus source code and the blind analysis from qkumba.

═╣ Abusing system registers ╠═════════════════════════════════════════════════
 ╙                          ╜
While working on this virus, I wanted to find a way to obfuscate immediate
values. I ended up coming up with an interesting technique, which on its own
isn't difficult to defeat, but could potentially present some annoying issues
to the analyst.

System registers often contain reserved set bits and predictable values. They
can be used as a seed at runtime to compute an arbitrary value that would
otherwise appear as an immediate. Starting with ARMv7, CTR_EL0 - the cache
type register - will always have the bit 31 reserved as set [0]. This bit
provides us with a power of 2 from a register that was never touched by our
code. This can be useful for obfuscating values, for instance when the parasite
allocates space on the stack. Makes tracking stack variables pretty annoying.

While that's fun, the technique really comes in handy when we try to obfuscate
syscall numbers:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Simple, but makes reversing tedious. Note that this technique isn't limited to
CTR_EL0 - it will work with any available system register with a RES1 (always
set) bit, or another predictable value. Similarly, to obfuscate a null value
you could grab a RES0, for instance shifting value in CTR_EL0 by 32 bits. To
keep things varied, you could switch the math around, shifting right by 31
bits instead of a bitwise and with 0x80000000.

If you're using a system register value to profile the host and determine
whether you want your virus to run, you could use this technique not only for
obfuscation, but to calculate potentially different syscall numbers if the
host matches or does not match the expected value.

As far as I know, no reverse engineering platform uses reserved system register
values in constant propagation. Indeed, when loading the virus into binja the
decompilation looks a bit rough.

While you can probably already think of some ways to defeat this technique, I
think it can still be effective against automated static analysis, and together
with anti-emulation present issues to less naive automatic analysis systems.

═╣ A note on PT_NOTE -> PT_LOAD ╠══════════════════════════════════════════════
 ╙                              ╜
A quick note on writing a PT_NOTE to PT_LOAD infector. The spec [1] says:
"executables and shared objects must have loadable program segments whose file
offsets and virtual addresses are congruent modulo the page size." So when
we're converting the PT_NOTE segment into a PT_LOAD segment we must make sure
that p_offset % PAGE_SIZE == p_vaddr % PAGE_SIZE. I chose to set p_offset of
the newly minted PT_LOAD segment to a page-aligned file offset. Since many
AARCH64 systems have 0x10000 pages, a reliable method to calculate our
infection offset is to add 0x10000 to the ELF's total size, followed by a page
alignment:

┌─┤ slotmachine.s ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
The p_vaddr will also be set to a page-aligned address. The tradeoff for the
simplicity and reliability is that this method isn't space-efficient.

═╣ Hijacking execution ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 ╙                     ╜
RISC architectures don't get the luxury of a single op far call, so accessing
virtual memory many pages away leaves a predictable pattern. In AARCH64, such a
pattern is an adrp instruction followed by either an ldr or add. One can run
into it hijacking the PLT and other GOT accesses (note that position dependent
code is out of scope). In the _start stub, this pattern serves as a convenient
anchor to hijack code flow. Let's take a look at an example:

If the target binary is ET_DYN the address of main will be served via GOT, so
the adrp instruction will be followed by an ldr to dereference the pointer into
GOT. In ET_EXEC binaries it's followed by an add to compute the address of the
wrap_main function. What if instead of the address of main, __libc_start_main
received the entry point of our virus? All we have to do is:

    1) Disassemble the adrp and the following adjusting instruction to
       calculate the branch target for the virus exit.
    2) Modify the adrp instruction to instead load the new PT_LOAD segment's
       page offset.
    3) If the virus entry point is at the top of the page, replace the
       following instruction with a nop, else patch in an adjusting
       instruction.

If you weren't lazy like me and decided to append your code flush with the
host's end of file, replace the nop with an adjusting instruction. Don't forget,
the file offset must be congruent to the new PT_LOAD segment's virtual address
modulo the page size.

A downside of this method is that some reverse engineering frameworks won't
just rely on symbols (binja ftw) making a smart deduction that the first
argument to __libc_start_main might just be the main function. If there is
already a main symbol, it will label the virus as main_<function address>,
otherwise it will lump it together with the real main function. This is likely
because we simply branch to main after the virus finished executing.

═╣ Metamorphic Engine ╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 ╙                    ╜
Mechanical slot machines are fascinating devices. They operate three or more
rotating reels, that display symbols to the player. Just like the mechanical
slot machine, the lookup table of sl^tmachine's metamorphic engine consists
of a series of rotating "reels" that display symbols. Each symbol describes how
an instruction or instructions will transform at the next morph point, and the
reel rotates each time the virus infects a new host. Although I wrote the virus
in assembly, I find it easier to represent a reel in C:

┌─┤ Representation of a reel in C ├───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    struct reel {                                                            │
│        uint16_t instruction_index;                                          │
│        uint8_t reel_max_index:4;                                            │
│        uint8_t reel_index:4;                                                │
│        uint8_t symbol_length;                                               │
│        uint32_t symbols[];                                                  │
│    };                                                                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
The instruction_index is an index of the first instruction in a series of
contiguous instructions. In the virus generated for this issue, it is often a
single instruction. The reel_max_index is the index of the last symbol in the
reel and the reel_index is the current position of the reel. The symbol_length
corresponds to a number of contiguous instructions that shall be modified at
morph point by this reel. For instance, if we're swapping two neighboring
instructions, symbol_length would be 2. So what are those symbols? It's pretty
simple - a symbol is a value that when xored with a current instruction will
transform it into the following instruction. So if a reel consists of three
symbols, the rotation would look like this:

┌─┤ Rotating 3-symbol reel ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ instruction0 ⊕ symbol0 = instruction1                                       │
│ instruction1 ⊕ symbol1 = instruction2                                       │
│ instruction2 ⊕ symbol2 = instruction0                                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Optionally, a reel may include one or several zero symbols that will not
transform the instruction. This allows reels containing the same number of
transformations to rotate at different speeds, resulting in more outcomes.
A nice alternative would have been to grab a pseudorandom number and use its
bits to determine whether a reel should rotate, but unfortunately I was running
out of time to complete the virus, so I left it as an exercise to the reader.

 Building and testing metamorphic code can be challenging. The sl^tmachine repo
 can be used as a starting point if you want to mess around with sl^tmachine
 code [2].

Just run make, duh. Seriously, the virus source consists of three parts. The
slotmachine_meat.s and slotmachine_tail.s are the head and tail of the virus
source respectively. In the middle goes a lookup table generated by the morph
table builder. The morph_table_builder is basically a harness around capstone
and keystone libraries written in C which will disassemble the plain virus and
generate the morph table. There is no domain specific language (DSL) - I just
used janky C logic to figure out whether a given instruction should have an
entry in the lookup table. With some effort it's possible to implement a more
sophisticated set of rules. The makefile will build the plain virus, build and
run morph_table_builder, put the generated virus source together, and build the
generated virus.

To test whether multiple generations of the virus will not break the host,
I made a super basic test environment, which runs the virus against a fresh
host, then replaces the virus with the infected host, and copies over a fresh
host once again in an infinite loop. It can be found in the evolution_chamber
directory. More info on running tests can be found in the repo's readme.
