─── HACKER'S MIND // BEGINNER'S MIND ───────────────────────────────────────\\──


Do you remember what it felt like the first time you touched a computer? How
about the first time you found out that you can make computers do what you
want them to? Or even the first time you saw a computer do something it wasn't
supposed to? Do you remember the sense of wonder? The sense of mystery? The
feeling of endless possibilities? In our journey toward understanding, it can
be easy to forget these feelings and lose sight of what brought us here in the
first place.

Maybe you feel stuck, like there are no possible paths forward. Maybe you feel
like you've learned all you need to know, and think you can predict the outcome
of a given situation with great precision, visualizing and computing all of the
possible paths, like a processor with speculative execution. Maybe this is only
part of the picture. Maybe this is part of the problem.

The hacker's mind is the beginner's mind. A mind that approaches things with all
options on the table. The only limitation is imagination. The beginner's mind
sees endless possibilities, while the expert's mind can only imagine a few.

Hackers see all the literature, the expert opinions, the public sentiment, the
press releases, the propaganda, and look directly at the core. They don't take
anything at face value. A 404 error, a fatal exception, a segmentation fault.
While on the surface these things may seem authoritative, hackers know that
they often indicate something much deeper to explore and understand. The best
way to truly know what something means is to find out for yourself.

Embracing a beginner's mind means liberating yourself from your preconceived
notions about something and face it as it is. What is it doing? What are you
doing? How is it affecting you? How can you affect it? When approaching
situations both unknown and familiar, you can apply this thinking to see
and experience things in their current form, and understand them more.

The purpose of learning how to hack is not to learn hacking, it is to learn
about ourselves and how we interact with the world around us. Let yourself
be curious. Or don't, who are we to tell you what to do? ;)
