    | ProcFS hooking: A new way of communication for LKM rootkits |
    '-------------------------------------------------------------'
    ~ lil.skelly

--[ Introduction ]------------------------------------------------------------

Kernel development can offer valuable lessons for system security.
I recently got started with kernel development myself, by creating my own
loadable kernel module rootkit (aka LKM rootkit).

As I was researching techniques used by other rootkits, I stumbled upon
something very interesting.

Most, if not all of these rootkits, seemed to hook the kill system call
in order to intercept signals sent to processes.  This was done to provide
an interface to the threat actor to communicate with the rootkit, making
it execute different commands at will.

And sure for simple research projects that's completely fine, but my
curiosity wanted to find another way and perhaps a better one.

You are in for a treat (I hope) as I will guide you through my
idea on how to make the communication with your rootkit more stealthy,
and secure.

--[ "But what's wrong with kill signals" ]------------------------------------

Well there is 1 main problem with this approach:
* Rootkits can only use signals ranging from 32 to 64
(range of process specific signals).
And that makes them very easily detectable.

* "And what are you going to do about it ¿¿¿"
Well hold your seats because the next part is awesome!


--[ Introduction to the procfs ]----------------------------------------------

The proc file system (aka procfs) is basically used as an interface to
internal data structures in the kernel.  It is used to obtain information
about processes as well as other system information and to change some
kernel parameters at runtime (sysctl).  For our purpose we will only focus
in the *system information* part.

Every entry in the proc file system provides information from the kernel.
It serves as a middleman for user-kernel (and back) communication.

Take for example /proc/module which gives information about all the modules
that are currently part of the kernel.  A user does not have access to
kernel space information and that's where procfs come in to play!  The user
can *simply* (subjective ;) create a procfs entry to do the job for him!

"Okay and how does that have anything to do wi-"

To understand why I'm telling you all this we need to go just a tad
bit deeper.  And by a tad bit I mean into how a procfs entry is actually
represented in the kernel.

--[ Inside a procfs entry ]---------------------------------------------------

    struct proc_dir_entry {
        atomic_t in_use;
        refcount_t refcnt;
        struct list_head pde_openers;

        spinlock_t pde_unload_lock;
        struct completion *pde_unload_completion;
        const struct inode_operations *proc_iops;
        union {
            const struct proc_ops *proc_ops;
            const struct file_operations *proc_dir_ops;
        };
        const struct dentry_operations *proc_dops;
        union {
            const struct seq_operations *seq_ops;
            int (*single_show)(struct seq_file *, void *);
        };
        proc_write_t write;
        void *data;
        unsigned int state_size;
        unsigned int low_ino;
        nlink_t nlink;
        kuid_t uid;
        kgid_t gid;
        loff_t size;
        struct proc_dir_entry *parent;
        struct rb_root subdir;
        struct rb_node subdir_node;
        char *name;
        umode_t mode;
        u8 flags;
        u8 namelen;
        char inline_name[];
    };

This structure holds vital information about the entry.  One very important
piece of information to us is the contained `proc_ops` structure.

    struct proc_ops {
        unsigned int proc_flags;
        int (*proc_open)(
            struct inode *,
            struct file *
        );
        ssize_t (*proc_read)(
            struct file *,
            char __user *,
            size_t,
            loff_t *
        );
        ssize_t (*proc_read_iter)(
            struct kiocb *,
            struct iov_iter *
        );
    };

`proc_ops` define how specific operations in the procfs entry should be
handled.  It basically contains function pointers to various operations
of that entry like read, write and more.
We are getting there . . .

--[ The idea ]----------------------------------------------------------------

The idea is to hook an operation of a specific entry to communicate with
our module.  Thankfully for us, there are a lot of entries to choose from so
every implementation will likely vary but the generic idea remains the same.

I chose to hook the read operation of the /proc/kallsyms entry.
It's read operation is defined as the function seq_read,
the read method for sequential files.

--[ "But why /proc/kallsyms ???" ]--------------------------------------------

The /proc/kallsyms file is a virtual file
provided by the Linux kernel.  It contains the symbol table used by the
kernel, which includes both function/variable names.  These symbols are
crucial for gaining information about the kernel and are especially useful
during module developing/debugging.

To sum up, we are using a trusted procfs entry as a front to communicate
under the radar with our rootkit We can write our commands into the buffer
which we will then pass to the read function (which ends up calling our
hooked seq_read).

But one can view the contents of that buffer at any time, so we have to
obfuscate them a little instead of just passing give-me-root.

--[ Making the packet ]-------------------------------------------------------

The idea was to translate the commands into single byte values, followed by
some random junk.  There are only 2^8 possible values for a byte meaning
that our hook will most certainly mistake some regular buffer contents
for a command and accidentally reveal our rootkit.

To overcome this we can use a checksum algorithm. I will not go in depth
about how checksums work as that is a bit out of our scope for today.
More specifically, we will use a cycle redundancy check mostly because it
is both simple and fast to calculate but it is also reliable enough for
our purposes.

Our buffer contents should look something like this:

    .--------------------------.
    | CMD | RANDOM BYTES | SUM |
    '--------------------------'

* For example:

    .-------------------------------.
    | 0xFA | 0xEADC080 | 0x2CFA3226 |
    '-------------------------------'
       '         '           '
       |         |           |
       '-> the command       |
                 |           |
                 '-> some random bytes
                             |
                             '-> CRC-32 Checksum


And then we will pass the buffer containing our command to the read syscall
(which ends up calling our hook):

    read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));

Our job in the kernel side from within the seq_read hook looks something like:

    .---------------------.
    |0xFA|EADC080|2CFA3226|
    '---------------------'
     |___________|    |                     _ YES -> Do your thing
     |             CRC-32 ---.   .------.  /
     |                       |-> |EQUAL?| -
     '-> Calculate checksum -'   '------'  \_ NO  -> Act innocent


If they match, execute the appropriate command. If not, act normally.

.-~~ NOTE ~~------------------------------------------------------------------.
| A basic feature of LKM rootkits is the ability to give root to              |
| the process issuing the command (commonly using kill). For our approach,    |
| we must depend on a helper binary (a client) to handle the communication,   |
| meaning that our LKM will only upgrade the privileges of the client process.|
| There are other things that require a PID too such as hiding processes etc. |
| Using kill syscalls is particularly convenient since you can just send      |
| the signal to that PID, so the kernel module knows exactly what to hide.    |
'-~~ END ~~-------------------------------------------------------------------'

Thus, we must include an additional field for a PID somewhere in our packet.
I chose to add it right after the random bytes:

    .--------------------------------.
    | CMD | RANDOM BYTES | PID | SUM |
    '--------------------------------'

.-~~ NOTE ~~-------------------------------------------------------------.
| I also managed to create a function for my LKM which safely upgrades   |
| the credentials of any arbitrary process given its PID (process ID).   |
| This is advised against in various kernel documentation, but rules are |
| made to be broken.                                                     |
|                                                                        |
| * See reference [1]                                                    |
'-~~ END ~~--------------------------------------------------------------'

The PID can be 0 if we are just hiding the module or doing stuff where we do
not need a PID We can start by defining our commands using a simple `enum`:

    /* example */
    typedef enum {
        SIG_HIDE = 0xFA,
        SIG_ROOT = 0xFB,
        ...
    };

We will also need some constants to help with extracting our command packets:

    enum {
        /* Component sizes */
        CMD_SIZE = sizeof(char),
        RAND_BYTES_SIZE = 4 * sizeof(char),
        PID_SIZE = sizeof(pid_t),
        CRC_SIZE = sizeof(uint32_t),

        TOTAL_SIZE = CMD_SIZE + RAND_BYTES_SIZE + PID_SIZE + CRC_SIZE,

        /* Offsets */
        PID_OFFSET = TOTAL_SIZE - (PID_SIZE + CRC_SIZE),
        CRC_OFFSET = TOTAL_SIZE - CRC_SIZE
    };

Now that we got some solid foundation to work on we can get started
on our hook.
We can see that the definition for our original function (seq_read) is:

    ssize_t seq_read(struct file *, char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);

All we have to do is copy it.
For those who have worked with syscall hooking before, don't worry.
We are not hooking a system call so we don't have to bother with
duplicating our hook to work with the new PT_REGS convention.

--[ Getting a copy of the buffer ]--------------------------------------------

The __user identifier for the buffer argument means that it points to
a userspace location that may not be mapped into our address space.

Meaning that trying to access/dereference the pointer will either result
in a seg fault or in junk being read from the address. To overcome this
the kernel provides us with a couple of functions for copying data from
and back into userspace.

To overcome this, the kernel provides us with a bunch of functions like
copy_from_user(), strncpy_from_user(), etc, as well as copy_to_user()
versions for copying data to and back into userspace.

    static asmlinkage ssize_t hook_seq_read(struct file *file, char __user
    *buf, size_t size, loff_t *ppos)

        char *kbuf; long error;

        /* packet components */ uint8_t sig; pid_t pid; uint32_t
        extracted_crc, calculated_crc;

        /* allocate a kernel buffer */
        kbuf = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!kbuf) {
        return orig_seq_read(file, buf, size, ppos); // immediately
        return the original function on error
        }

        // copy the user buffer to kernel space (kbuf)
        error = copy_from_user(kbuf, buf, size);
        if (error) {
            kfree(kbuf); return orig_seq_read(file, buf, size, ppos);
        }

        if (size < TOTAL_SIZE) { // check if we are working with the
        right amount of data
            kfree(kbuf);
            return orig_seq_read(file, buf, size, ppos);
    }
    ...

And we can now work with the buffer contents!

--[ Extracting the components ]-----------------------------------------------

Next, we have to extract our command, pid and checksum.  We can use memcpy
to safely extract the PID and the CRC checksum from our packet.

    sig = (uint8_t)kbuf[0]; // the signal is the first byte memcpy(&pid,
    kbuf + PID_OFFSET, PID_SIZE); memcpy(&extracted_crc, kbuf +
    CRC_OFFSET, CRC_SIZE);

--[ Verifying the checksum ]--------------------------------------------------

Now we need to calculate a checksum of the data (CMD + RANDOM JUNK + PID)
and compare it to the one we previously extracted.  Make sure that the
client used a CRC-32 implementation using the same polynomial as the one
in our kernel module.

    calculated_crc = crc32(kbuf, TOTAL_SIZE - CRC_SIZE); if
    (calculated_crc != extracted_crc) {
        kfree(kbuf); return orig_seq_read(file, buf, size, ppos);
    }

--[ Proceed to execute command ]----------------------------------------------

Once the packet is verified, you can execute the appropriate command.
This might involve hiding a module, upgrading privileges, or any other
actions relevant to your rootkit's functionality.  It is all up to you.

Just don't forget to cleanup after you complete your job by returning a
call to the original read function.

--[ Conclusion ]--------------------------------------------------------------

Using standard procfs operations for communicating with a rootkit allows
for a more discreet method than traditional signal-based communication.
By utilizing this method you can make your rootkit's communication harder
to detect and more flexible.

--[ The END ]-----------------------------------------------------------------

That is all for today, I hope you found this technique as exciting as I
did and that you learnt a thing or two along the way.  Kernel development
might sometimes seem scary--and it is, but never give up.  Stay curious,
stay determined, and never stop hacking!

I want to thank everybody from the tmp.out and rootSYN communities.
